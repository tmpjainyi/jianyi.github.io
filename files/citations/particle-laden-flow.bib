  abstract = {A constitutive equation for computing particle concentration and
velocity fields in concentrated monomodal suspensions is proposed that
consists of two parts: a Newtonian constitutive equation in which the
viscosity depends on the local particle volume fraction and a diffusion
equation that accounts for shear-induced particle migration. Particle
flux expressions used to obtain the diffusion equation are derived by
simple scaling arguments. Predictions are made for the particle volume
fraction and velocity fields for steady Couette and Poiseuille flow, and
for transient start-up of steady shear flow in a Couette apparatus.
Particle concentrations for a monomodal suspension of polymethyl
methacrylate spheres in a Newtonian solvent are measured by nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging in the Couette geometry for two
particle sizes and volume fractions. The predictions agree remarkably
well with the measurements for both transient and steady-state
experiments as well as for different particle sizes.

  abstract      = {Particles suspended in a film flow can either settle out of the flow,
remain well mixed, or even advance faster than the fluid, accumulating
at the moving contact line. Recent experiments by Zhou  [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 94, 117803 (2005)] have demonstrated that these three settling
behaviors can be achieved by control of the average particle
concentration  {\phiv}  and inclination angle  {\thetas} . This work
presents a theory for determining the settling behavior in the Stokes
regime by calculating the depth profile of  {\phiv}  and the
depth-averaged velocities of the liquid and particle phases. It is found
that shear-induced particle fluxes can lead to an inversely stratified
flow, in which the particles move on average faster than the liquid. The
theory is directly compared to Zhou {\rsquo}s experimental data, and the
implications of stratification for lubrication-type models are also
discussed.
